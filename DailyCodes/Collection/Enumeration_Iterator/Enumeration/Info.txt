Enumeration interface is part of the legacy java Collections Framework and is used for iterating over a collection of objects. it was a precursor to the more powerful and flexible iterator
interface introduced later .

The enumeration interface is defined in the java.util package 

The enumeration interface has two main methods : 

1) boolean hasMoreElements() : Returns true if there are more elements to iterate over

2) Object nextElement() : Returns the next element in the enumeration 

Enumeration is often used with older collection classes like vector and hashtable . it provides a way to iterate over elements without the ability to modify the collection during iteration

Limitations : Unlike the iterator interface , Enumeration has fewer methods and does not support the removal of elements during iteration. its a read-only interface for traversing elements
