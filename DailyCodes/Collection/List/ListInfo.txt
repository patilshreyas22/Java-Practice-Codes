Allows Duplicate Data

Insertion Order is Preserved

ArrayList Capacity Increases as : newCapacity = oldCapacity * 3/2

List is an INTERFACE , so you need to use its reference and some other class's object : ArrayList , LinkedList , Vector , Stack

why use List : Dynamic Resizing , Methods : add() , remove() , get() simplify the element management , index-based accessing , iterator support 

If the size of the collection is unknown or may change during runtime , you should use a list , LISTS automatically resize as you add or remove elements , unlike arrays which have a fixed 
size

the default capacity of the ArrayList is 10

The ArrayList class belongs to the UTIL PACKAGE of Java
