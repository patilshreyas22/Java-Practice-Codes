 
The Stack class in Java is Last In,First Out (LIFO) data strucutr that extends the Vector Class.

It operates by adding and removing elements in such a way that the last element added to the stack is the first on removed 

It is considered as a legacy class

In modern java it is recommended to use Deque (like ArrayDeque) or LinkedList for stack-like behavior due to their better performance and flexibility. However Stack is still widely used
in older codebases

Basic Operations of Stack : 

1) Push : Add an element to the top of the stack
2) Pop : Remove and return the top element from the stack
3) peek : view the top element without removing it
4) search : find the position of an element in the stack
5) Empty : Check if the stack is empty
