bytecode will come first into the method area 

there will be two bytecodes as there are two classes 

each class will have its own bytecode

now static blocks will come into the picture

in the static blocks there will be static variables initialized 

then special structures will come into the picture 

static blocks comes in picture only when there is explicitly you have written static variable or static block 

from inside the main we can access the static data of that same class only
